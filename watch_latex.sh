# LaTeX Auto-Compiler with Cross-Platform File Watching (macOS & Linux)
# This script watches for changes to .tex files and automatically recompiles them.
# It detects the operating system and uses the appropriate file watcher.

# --- Configuration ---
TEX_FILE="homework_template.tex"  # Change this to your main .tex file
LATEX_CMD="pdflatex --shell-escape -synctex=1 -interaction=nonstopmode -file-line-error"

# --- Colors for output ---
RED='\033[0;31m'
GREEN='\033[0;32m'
YELLOW='\033[1;33m'
NC='\033[0m' # No Color

# --- Utility Functions ---
# Function to check if a command exists
command_exists() {
    command -v "$1" >/dev/null 2>&1
}

# --- Main Script Functions ---
# Function to compile the LaTeX document
compile_latex() {
